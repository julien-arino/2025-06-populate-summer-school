These are the files required to compile the slides. Although a LaTeX version is provided, it is best to knit the `Rnw` files. 

- The `FIGS` directory contains figures required for compiling the slides as well as figures generated by `R` when the `Rnw` files are knit.
- The `FIGS-slides-admin` directory contains figures used for transition between sections, logos and the like.
- The `slides-setup-*.tex` files are style and definition files used when compiling the beamer presentations.
- `compile-and-push` is a batch script that compiles the files and pushes the results to this github repo. Of course, it will be useless to you since I only have write access to the repo, but illustrates running the code from the command line.
- `2025-06-populate-summer-school.Rproj` is an `RStudio` project file that makes compiling the `Rnw` files easy.
