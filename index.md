## 3MC-PIMS-ICMS Winter School 2024

This GitHub repo contains my lectures for the December 2024 [3MC-PIMS-ICMS Winter School](https://www.icms.org.uk/workshops/2024/multiscale-modeling-infectious-diseases-cancer-and-treatments-winter-school) held at ICMS in Edinburgh 02-13 December 2024.

Here, you will find code and slides.

### This GitHub repo

On the [GitHub version](https://github.com/julien-arino/3MC-2024-12-ICMS/) of the page, you have access to all the files. You can also download the entire repository by clicking the buttons on the left. (You can also of course clone this repo, but you will need to do that from the GitHub version of the site.)

Feel free to use the material in these slides or in the folders. If you find this useful, I will be happy to know.
